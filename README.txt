Directions:

    Start: To start the program you must simply compile and run your code in the Main file using JDK 17.0.1

    Operation: The program is pretty basic and all functionality is laid out for the user. The login must be in the user
                database. You can use either User:test Password:test or User:admin password:admin


Additional Report:

    Description: The idea behind my additional report is pretty simple. In the year of 2023 we are working more remote than
                 ever and it only makes sense that for your employees, they should be able to quickly figure out where their
                 appointments are taking place. That is why my reports will show the customers based on the location of the
                 appointments. That way it is easy for the user to figure out who is having the meetings and where.
